Customers typically don't make instantaneous decisions to switch to a competitor; instead, this transition tends to occur gradually over a period, particularly among high-value customers. In the context of churn prediction, we operate on the assumption that the customer lifecycle can be segmented into three distinct phases -
The 'good' phase,In this phase customers find satisfaction in the service, exhibiting contentment and maintaining their usual behavior.
The ‘action’ phase: In this phase the customer experience takes a downturn. This may be triggered by compelling offers from competitors, unjust charges, or dissatisfaction with service quality. During this phase, customers often exhibit behavior that diverges from their patterns in the 'good' months. Identifying high-churn-risk customers becomes crucial in this stage, as it presents an opportunity for corrective actions, such as matching competitor offers or enhancing service quality.
The ‘churn’ phase: In this phase, the customer is deemed to have churned.
